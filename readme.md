## Programmable IP for the Integrity Web

Mediolano empowers creators, artists and organizations to make money from their content, without requiring them to know anything about crypto.

With permissionless services for Programmable Intellectual Property (IP), leveraging Starknet’s high-speed, low-cost transactions and zero-knowledge proofs, Mediolano provides a comprehensive suite of solutions to tokenize and monetize assets efficiently, transparently and with sovereignty.

With zero fees, Mediolano’s open-source protocol and dapp ensures immediate tokenization and protection under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1886), covering 181 countries. This framework guarantees global recognition of authorship, providing verifiable proof of ownership for 50 to 70 years, depending on jurisdiction.

The platform also introduces advanced monetization, enabling diverse approaches to licensing, royalties, and financing creators economies. These tools are designed to offer integrations with various ecosystems, including communities, games, and AI agents, unlocking the true power of Programmable IP for the Integrity Web.
